# Reproducibility Project 2

## Data Background

This is the seconf project for the course "Reproducible Research" offered through Coursera and Johns Hopkins.  This project looks at data collected by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The data set we start off with is given below.

* [NOAA Storm Data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2)

And we have some further documentation for the data:

* [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)


## Project Details

For this project, we are taked with answering two questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

The goal is to answer these questions and give full documentation in a .Rmd file which we then knit and publish.  I'll include all necessary files here on Github.  This can be found on R pubs as well:
